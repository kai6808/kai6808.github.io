I am currently a first-year M.A.Sc. student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.toronto.edu) at [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca), under the supervision of [Prof. Baochun Li](https://iqua.ece.toronto.edu/bli/index.html) in [iQua](https://iqua.ece.toronto.edu/) research group. My current research focuses on the intersection of **Networking** and **Deep Learning**.

I received my B.Eng. degree with Honours, First Class from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en) in 2022, majored in Computer Science and Engineering and advised by [Prof. Fangxin Wang](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/wangfangxin/).

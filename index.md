## Short Bio

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electrical and
Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.toronto.edu) at [University of
Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), where I am co-supervised by [Prof. Angela
Demke Brown](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~demke/) and [Prof. Eyal de
Lara](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delara/) as part of the [Computer System & Networks
Group](https://csng.cs.toronto.edu/index.php). I received my B.Eng. degree with Honours, First Class from [The Chinese University
of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en) in 2022, majored in Computer
Science and Engineering under the supervision of [Prof. Fangxin
Wang](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/wangfangxin/).


My research interests broadly lie at the intersection of **systems** and
**networking** - with a current focus on building efficient memory management
systems. From 2023 to early 2024, I developed packet-level, Transformer-based
network performance estimators with scalability and generality, as well as a Rust-powered, process-based
high-performance
network simulator.
Earlier, my work focused on server-driven adaptive realtime video streaming.

## Research Interests

- **Operating Systems:** memory management, cloud computing
- **Computer Networks:** network simulation, multimeida streaming
